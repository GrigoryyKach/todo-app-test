# Todo App

A modern Todo application built with Next.js that leverages the JSONPlaceholder API for demo data. It features full CRUD operations, optimistic UI updates, and drag-and-drop reordering with framer-motion. The app persists data locally using localStorage and supports editing via double-click or a dedicated edit button, ensuring an intuitive experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
